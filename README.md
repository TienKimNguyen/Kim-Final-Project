# Kim-Final-Project

Auhors: Kim Tien Nguyen

We are making a application that will create a diet and directions to follow in order to live a healthy lifestyle. It'll have selections for our user's features ex.(weight, daily activities). Based on the input from the user the app will generate a menu of dietary measures and simple exercises that could be done to improve the user's lifestyle. The diet menus will be already structured it will just be called upon based on different aspects of the user's input. For example their current weight and desired weight. The app can be split in the very beginning it will ask what the user is here for. We can have two options one for Diet another for Sickness/Disease.

Some features included:
