# Kim-Richard-Project
psuedo code We are making a application that will create a diet and directions to follow in order to live a healthy lifestyle. It'll have selections for our user's features ex.(weight, daily activities). Based on the input from the user the app will generate a menu of dietary measures and simple exercises that could be done to improve the user's lifestyle. The diet menus will be already structured it will just be called upon based on different aspects of the user's input. For example their current weight and desired weight.
